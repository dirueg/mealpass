This ensures the margin scales properly across different devices.\\n\\n- By defining the dimension here rather than in res/values/dimens.xml, it allows having different margin values for landscape vs portrait orientations. This is useful for adjusting UI layouts based on available screen space.\\n\\n- At runtime, Android will select the dimension defined here when the device is in landscape, rather than the default value, to support orientation-specific resources.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines an orientation-specific dimension resource to control UI padding for landscape layouts.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/values-night/themes.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a night mode theme for the Android application.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Located in the res/values-night folder, which tells Android this theme is for night/dark mode.\\n\\n- Defines a style called Base.Theme.MyApplication that inherits from the Material3 DayNight NoActionBar theme. \\n\\n- This makes the app use the Material Design 3 night mode theme as a base.\\n\\n- Can customize dark theme colors/attributes here by overriding items like colorPrimary etc. \\n\\n- Allows defining custom night mode colors, styles, etc that will be applied when the user enables night/dark mode on their device.\\n\\n- The parent Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar theme automatically switches between light and dark based on the system setting.\\n\\n- So this file defines the custom night mode look and feel without having to manually switch themes based on night mode state.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a custom night mode theme that inherits automatic day/night functionality to apply a dark theme variant when the user enables night mode.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/xml/backup_rules.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This backup_rules.xml file controls what data from the app is backed up during automatic device backups.\\n\\nThe key functions of this file are:\\n\\n- It allows including or excluding specific types of app data from backups. The main types are shared preferences, files, and databases.\\n\\n- The \\u003cinclude\\u003e tag specifies data that should be included in backups. For example \\u003cinclude domain\\u003d\\\&quot;sharedpref\\\&quot; path\\u003d\\\&quot;.\\\&quot;/\\u003e would back up all shared preference files. \\n\\n- The \\u003cexclude\\u003e tag specifies data that should be excluded from backups. For example \\u003cexclude domain\\u003d\\\&quot;sharedpref\\\&quot; path\\u003d\\\&quot;device.xml\\\&quot;/\\u003e would exclude a specific shared preference file.\\n\\n- By default, nothing is included for backup unless specified. So this file allows the developer to selectively choose what user-generated app data is important to backup.\\n\\n- It helps reduce the size of backups by only including necessary data, rather than backing up entire databases or file directories by default.\\n\\n- The comments indicate this file is only used on Android 12 and higher, where automatic backups were introduced. On older Android versions it has no effect.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides fine-grained control over what app data is included in automatic device backups for the user.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML layout file defines the user interface for the MainActivity in the app.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines a ConstraintLayout as the root layout container\\n- Contains a RelativeLayout that positions the child views \\n- Displays the date in a TextView at the top\\n- Has a ScrollView that will dynamically add ToggleButtons \\n- Contains a SignatureView widget to capture user signatures\\n- Includes buttons to confirm, save the signature, and switch to manager mode\\n- Lays out the views in a relative positioning within the RelativeLayout\\n- Sets IDs, dimensions, margins/padding to control view positioning and sizing\\n\\nIn summary, it defines the main UI layout for the activity, including displaying the date, providing a scrollable list of options, capturing signatures, and buttons to confirm, save and switch modes. The RelativeLayout positions all the child views within the ConstraintLayout root view.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_manager_page.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML layout file defines the user interface for an activity called ManagerPageActivity.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It uses a ConstraintLayout as the root layout to position child views.\\n\\n- It includes a TabLayout widget to display tabs at the top of the screen. \\n\\n- The TabLayout contains 3 TabItem widgets for the tabs - one for \\\&quot;직원목록 수정\\\&quot;, one for \\\&quot;기간 통계\\\&quot; and one for \\\&quot;그 외 설정?\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- The TabLayout is constrained to the top of the parent layout to display horizontally across the screen. \\n\\n- Tapping on the different tabs will allow the user to switch between different fragments/views inside the activity.\\n\\n- This implements a common tabbed interface pattern where the tabs are static and allow switching between different inner content areas of the activity.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a tabbed layout interface for the activity with 3 tabs to switch between different manager-related views/functions.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/layout/list_fragment.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML file defines the layout for a fragment that displays a list.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines the outer container as a FrameLayout, which is a basic layout that stacks child views on top of each other. This allows other views to be overlayed on top of the list if needed.\\n\\n- Sets the width and height of the FrameLayout to match the parent container.\\n\\n- Defines a ListView with id nameListView to display the list items. \\n\\n- Sets the ListView width and height to match the parent FrameLayout, so it fills the entire fragment space.\\n\\n- The ListView will display the list of items and handle scrolling, selection, etc. It is the core component for displaying a list on Android.\\n\\n- Together this defines a simple fragment layout containing just a ListView to display a list of data populated from another source like an adapter. Other views could be added on top of the list as needed within the FrameLayout.\\n\\nSo in summary, it sets up a basic list fragment layout with a ListView to display list items that can be populated from elsewhere.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This themes.xml file defines the themes used in the Android application.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines the base theme \\\&quot;Base.Theme.MyApplication\\\&quot; which inherits from the Material3 DayNight theme with no action bar. This will be the parent theme for other themes.\\n\\n- Allows customizing the base theme by uncommenting things like the primary color. \\n\\n- Defines the main theme \\\&quot;Theme.MyApplication\\\&quot; which inherits from the base theme. This will be the default theme used in the app.\\n\\n- Located in res/values/themes.xml so it can provide theme configurations that work on all configurations like language and screen size.\\n\\n- Uses the Material3 component theme which provides Material Design styling and behaviors out of the box.\\n\\n- Allows easily creating additional themes by defining a new style that inherits from Base.Theme.MyApplication and setting it as the parent theme.\\n\\n- Provides a common place to define themes and theme attributes rather than specifying them individually everywhere.\\n\\nSo in summary, it centrally defines the default themes and base theme used in the app for a consistent styling experience across configurations.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/values-w600dp/dimens.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This file is defining dimension resources specifically for large/xlarge screens that are 600dp wide or larger.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It is located in the values-w600dp folder, which tells Android to use these dimension values only for screens that are 600dp or wider. The w in values-w600dp stands for \\\&quot;width\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- It defines a \\u003cdimen\\u003e resource named \\\&quot;activity_horizontal_margin\\\&quot; with a value of 48dp. Dimen resources are used to define dimension values like widths, heights, margins, paddings etc. \\n\\n- By defining this margin dimension specifically for larger screens, it allows using larger margins/paddings on bigger screens to take advantage of the additional screen space.\\n\\n- This helps support different screen sizes by allowing dimension values to vary based on certain screen width thresholds. So screens 600dp+ wide will use this 48dp margin value, while smaller screens may use a smaller default margin value.\\n\\n- It follows the principle of resource qualification in Android - providing alternative resources for specific configuration qualifiers like screen width/density etc. This is important for responsive and adaptive UI design.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a dimension resource for larger screens to allow for more spacing/margins on bigger displays in a responsive way.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
